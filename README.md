# ThunderbirdObsidianClipper
ObsidianClipper is an AddOn for the Thunderbird email client that lets a user clip messages to the Obsidian notetaking application. Both applications are open source and free to use, just like this AddOn!

## Installation
- You will first need to have the Obsidian notetaking app on your local platform as well as the Thunderbird email client.
  - You can download Thunderbird for free [here](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/download/).
  - You can download Obsidian for free [here](https://obsidian.md/download).
- After installing ObsidianClipper to your Thunderbird client, select the Options tab (*Settings->Add-Ons Manager->Obsidian Clipper->Options tab*) and configure the AddOn to work with Obsidian on your machine.
  - *Obsidian Vault Name* - is the name of the vault you created to keep your notes in when you set up Obsidian.
  - *Not Folder Path* - an optional parameter that allows the user to specifiy a location within the
  vault to place clipped emails. If this parameter is left blank, new notes in Obsidian will appear
  in the location indicated in 'Settings->Files & Links->Default location for new notes'.
  - *Note Filename and Content Templates* - allow you to specify how your clipped emails will be formatted and how the files will be named.
- After that, you're rady to clip emails!

## Usage
To use ObsidianClipper, just select an email and look for the "Obsidian" icon on the header (where you will also find the Reply and Forward buttons). Press the "Obsidian" button and your Obsidian applicaiton will launch and load your vault and your email will be clipped into Obsidian!
